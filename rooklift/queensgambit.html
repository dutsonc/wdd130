            One of the most popular openings in Chess, and the title of a popular Netflix series, the Queen's Gambit is a must-have weapon in any chess players arsenal. As its name suggests, this opening is a gambit, meaning that while it involves potentially sacrificing some material early on, it can often lead to significant advantages as the game progresses. While not the most secure opening, the Queen's Gambit (QG) can provide the player with the white pieces with early advantages, sharp traps, and attacking opportunities in just a few moves.

            To begin the game, white plays the move pawn to d4. This is the second most popular first move for white and is often referred to as the Queen's Pawn Opening. This initial move puts a pawn in the center of the board, and immediately protects the e5 square, and the c5 square. Without getting into the weeds, this move is one of the two most sensible ways to begin. Following white's move, black plays pawn to d5, which prevents white from playing pawn to e4 on their second move, contesting the center, and creating space in front of the queen. In response to e4, white's second move then, the move for which the QG gets its name, is pawn to c4. This image displays what the position will look like at this point, with black to move.
