        Welcome to Rooklift! If you wanted to learn more about chess, you've found the right place!
        Here at Rooklift we aim to provide quality Chess information, and access to resources to help you bring some competition to the board. From first-time players to Class D players, there is probably something here for you. We provide access to simplified knowledge, through lessons, and coaching. 
        With endless possibilities, and centuries of history, Chess can seem daunting to even the most level-headed player, so it's important that if you're going to learn more, you stay humble, and play hard. Our goal is to help you become the chess player that you want to be, and we'd be honored to be your first, or fifth, step on the path to proficiency.

      <h3>Coaching</h3>
      <p>
        The game of Chess would mean practically nothing if we played it alone. Luckily, not only do we not have to play the game by ourselves, but we also don't have to learn it by ourselves either. One of the best ways to improve quickly is with the help of an experienced coach, who can help you find where you're making mistakes, and what skills you can leverage to get to the next level. My name is Cole Dutson, and I've been teaching chess for the past 5 years. I've had several students, formally, and informally, all of which have seen improvements to their play with just a few hours of coaching. I've taught players ranging from never having played the game, to 1000 Elo beginners who are starting to effectively implement tactics and strategy both over the board, and online. The graph shown is the improvement one of my students saw in less than a year!

        The best part about my coaching though, is the cost. For many coaches, one-on-one lessons might cost you upwards of $25 dollars an hour! I provide quality coaching at a much more affordable rate of $15 an hour for one-on-one lessons and can provide group lessons even cheaper (price depends on group size). I teach in-person in the Rexburg, ID area, but have also taught lessons remotely for players across the country. 
        
        If reading about chess isn't enough, or you just want a second opinion, coaching is a great option. I, myself, have had coaches in the past, and have learned a great deal from them, that I can then pass on to you. If you are interested in group, or one-on-one lessons, I can be reached at: cole.dutson@gmail.com, or through direct messages on my Facebook Page.

      <h3>Queen's Gambit Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        One of the most popular openings in Chess, and the title of a popular Netflix series, the Queen's Gambit is a must-have weapon in any chess players arsenal. As its name suggests, this opening is a gambit, meaning that while it involves potentially sacrificing some material early on, it can often lead to significant advantages as the game progresses. While not the most secure opening, the Queen's Gambit (QG) can provide the player with the white pieces with early advantages, sharp traps, and attacking opportunities in just a few moves. 
        To begin the game, white plays the move pawn to d4. This is the second most popular first move for white and is often referred to as the Queen's Pawn Opening. This initial move puts a pawn in the center of the board, and immediately protects the e5 square, and the c5 square. Without getting into the weeds, this move is one of the two most sensible ways to begin. Following white's move, black plays pawn to d5, which prevents white from playing pawn to e4 on their second move, contesting the center, and creating space in front of the queen. In response to e4, white's second move then, the move for which the QG gets its name, is pawn to c4. This image displays what the position will look like at this point, with black to move.
