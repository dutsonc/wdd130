       <p class="coach-p1">The game of Chess would mean practically nothing if we played it alone. Luckily, not only do we not have to play the game by ourselves, but we also don't have to learn it by ourselves either. One of the best ways to improve quickly is with the help of an experienced coach, who can help you find where you're making mistakes, and what skills you can leverage to get to the next level.</p>

       <p class="coach-p2">My name is Cole Dutson, and I've been teaching chess for the past 5 years. I've had several students, formally, and informally, all of which have seen improvements to their play with just a few hours of coaching. I've taught players ranging from never having played the game, to 1000 Elo beginners who are starting to effectively implement tactics and strategy both over the board, and online. The graph shown is the improvement one of my students saw in less than a year!

         The best part about my coaching though, is the cost. For many coaches, one-on-one lessons might cost you upwards of $25 dollars an hour! I provide quality coaching at a much more affordable rate of $15 an hour for one-on-one lessons and can provide group lessons even cheaper (price depends on group size). I teach in-person in the Rexburg, ID area, but have also taught lessons remotely for players across the country. </p>

         <p class="coach-p3"> If reading about chess isn't enough, or you just want a second opinion, coaching is a great option. I, myself, have had coaches in the past, and have learned a great deal from them, that I can then pass on to you.
