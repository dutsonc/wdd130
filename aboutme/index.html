    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <h2>Cole Dutson</h2>
    <p>Hello World! I'm Cole, and I am an absolute Chess fanatic. I have been playing for over a decade now, and it is in fact, most of my personality. I am on my second to last semester studying Psychology, with an Emphasis in Health, and as much as I'm ready to be done, I think that this is all coming to an end too quickly. </p>

    <p>I have been married for just over two years to my wonderful wife Sarah, and we have a Golden Doodle who will be two in March named Maggie.</p>
    <p>I'm not sure how often Psych majors take web, CS, or IT courses, but I really wanted to learn a bit aboout all of these things so that if I need to create, or manage my own site in the future, I'll hopefully have the skills to make to make it happen. It doesn't hurt that my father is a programmer, too.</p>
    <p>Frankly, understanding even the basics of how websites work has been a great gift to me, as it's allowed me to help others, and has given me the confidence to try and fix problems I encounter.</p>
    <p>Finally, I want to mention that I am a convert to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and the love of our Savior, Jesus Christ has changed my life in ways that even my closest friends are awstruck by. I'm grateful for all of the wonderful members, and their inflence and teaching, which brought me to the truth of God's love for His Children, and I wouldn't trade it for the world.</p>
    <h3>Thanks for Visiting!</h3>
